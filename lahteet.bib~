@article{Hogan07,
Abstract = {We describe a program for involving undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs) in many types of psychology courses, as well as a 1-credit seminar for preparation of UTAs. The program, widely used by both faculty and students, has matured over a 10-year period. The seminar covers such topics as course organization, evaluation procedures, and videotaping a class presentation. UTAs sign a contract that includes ethical challenges they may encounter. We outline the potential benefits of the program for the UTAs, fellow students, the faculty, and the institution. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
